#      2D Space Shooter
Welcome to **2D Space Shooter**!
I have developed this project to solidify my knowledge of several software development patterns: Singleton, Interfaces, Abstract classes, and Object Pooling.
Classic games like Raiden Fighters and Strikers 1945 inspire the project.
After 2 weeks of rapid development, I have concentrated on polishing existing aspects of the game for scalability and further development by improving scenes and scripts.
Currently, the project features a 2D vertical scroller gameplay where the player can move, shoot, and get a score for surviving the longest. Enemy scout ships attack the player while moving according to the sine wave movement pattern, and the player also has to evade asteroids of different sizes.
## Project Features
-	Single-Responsibility Classes
-	Manager vs. Behaviour Separation
-	Use of Proper Namespaces
-	Use of Interfaces and (Abstract) Base Classes
-	Use of Singleton Development Pattern
-	Object Pooling to save memory

## Setup Instructions
**Environment Setup:** Uses Unity 2022.3.19f1, Cinemachine and Unity New Input System.
